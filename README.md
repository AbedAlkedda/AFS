# Automata Problem Solver

It solves some of the automata and formal languages problems:

* L1:
  * convert NFA to DFA
  * convert DFA to REG
  * convert DFA to minimal DFA
  * Pumping Lemma _need to be fixed_

L2:
  * Chomsky normal form
    * Epsilon free: remove rules like (S, Îµ) _need to be fixed_
    * Chaining free: remove rules like (S, T) _need to be fixed_
    * Normal cases: working :)
  * CYK
    * solve word problem
    * CYK matrix
